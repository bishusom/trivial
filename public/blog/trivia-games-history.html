        <p>Trivia – those bite-sized nuggets of knowledge that spark friendly competition and fuel our inner know-it-all. But where did this fascination with obscure facts and figures originate? Buckle up, trivia enthusiasts, as we embark on a journey through the fascinating history of trivia games.</p>
        <p><b>From Ancient Gatherings to Parlor Pastimes:</b><br>
            The human desire to test and share knowledge is as old as civilization itself. 
            Ancient gatherings often involved storytelling and riddles, forms of intellectual entertainment that laid the groundwork for modern trivia. However, the structured format we recognize today began to take shape much later. 
            The 18th and 19th centuries saw the rise of "parlor games" in Europe and America. 
            These gatherings, often held in affluent homes, featured games that tested wit and knowledge. 
            Think of charades, word puzzles, and question-and-answer sessions. These were the precursors to our modern trivia nights.
            
        <p><b>The Rise of Information and the Birth of "Trivia":</b><br>
            The word "trivia" itself has an interesting etymology. 
            It comes from the Latin word "trivium," which referred to the three basic liberal arts subjects taught in medieval universities: grammar, rhetoric, and logic. 
            Over time, "trivia" came to signify commonplace or insignificant information. 
            The explosion of printed materials and mass media in the 20th century fueled the public's appetite for information. 
            Radio quiz shows became a popular form of entertainment, testing listeners' knowledge on a wide range of subjects.

            The mid-20th century witnessed the rise of board games specifically designed for trivia. Games like "Trivial Pursuit," released in 1979, became a global phenomenon, sparking a trivia craze that continues to this day. Its success demonstrated the enduring appeal of testing one's knowledge in a fun and competitive setting.
            
            Television also played a pivotal role in popularizing trivia. Game shows like "Jeopardy!" and "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" captivated audiences with their challenging questions and dramatic formats.
        </p>    
            
        <p><b>The Digital Age and Trivia's Evolution:</b><br>
            The internet has revolutionized the way we access and engage with trivia. Online quizzes, trivia apps, and virtual trivia nights have made it easier than ever to test our knowledge and compete with friends and strangers alike.
